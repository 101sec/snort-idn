The internationalized domain name (IDN) homograph attack is a way a malicious party may deceive computer users about what remote system they are communicating with, by exploiting the fact that many different characters look alike, (i.e., they are homographs, hence the term for the attack). For example, a regular user of example.com may be lured to click a link where the Latin A is replaced with the Cyrillic A. source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack

I have made a proof of concept detection capability for Snort to detect IDN homograph attacks.
